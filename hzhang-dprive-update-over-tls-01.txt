                        Dynamic Updates over TLS
                     draft-ietf-xml2rfc-template-06

Abstract

   DNS dynamic updates are transmitted in clear text, allowing attackers
   the opportunity to collect the content of updates to a zone by
   eavesdropping on network connections.  RFC3007 defines a means to
   secure dynamic updates, allowing only authorized sources to make
   changes to a zone's contents, but it does not add confidentiality.
   This document specifies the use of TLS, rather than clear text, to
   prevent zone content collection via passive monitoring of dynamic
   updates: dynamic updatedates over TLS (DUoT).

1.  Introduction

   DNS privacy vulnerabilities, are discussed in detail in [RFC7626].
   Stub client to recursive resolver query privacy is now standards
   track for both DNS-over-TLS (DoT) [RFC7858] and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)
   [RFC8484], and a proposal for DNS-over-QUIC is underway
   [I-D.ietf-dprive-dnsoquic].  There is ongoing work on DNS privacy
   requirements for exchanges between recursive resolvers and
   authoritative servers [I-D.ietf-dprive-phase2-requirements] (TODO add
   info about dot ALPN )

   The contents of a zone could include sensitive information such as
   names of persons or customer coprporations.  Best practice is not to
   use personal information for domain names, but many such domain names
   exist.  [RFC5155] specifies NSEC3, a mechanism to provide measures
   against zone enumeration for DNSSEC signed zones, but it does not
   address data obtained outside zone enumeration.
   [I-D.draft-ietf-dprive-xfr-over-tls] prevents zone content collection
   via passive monitoring of zone transfers: XFR-over-TLS (XoT).
   However, besides XFR, a zone can also be updated by dynamic updates
   that is specified in [RFC2136].

   [RFC3007] defines means to secure dynamic updates using TSIG
   [RFC8945] or SIG(0) [RFC2931], allowing only authorized sources to
   make changes to a zone's contents.  Section 8.1.5 of NIST guide
   [nist-guide] specifies restricting Dynamic Update transaction
   Entities using IP-based ACL.  [RFC2931] recommends default UDP
   transport for Dynamic Updates and has following recommendation for
   TCP usage.

   If the requestor used TCP, then the response will be sent back on the
   requestor's open TCP

   This document updates the recommendation of [RFC2931] to use DNS-
   over-TLS [RFC7858] to prevent zone content collection from passive
   monitoring of dynamic updates to a zone.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] and [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Privacy terminology is as described in Section 3 of [RFC6973].

   DNS terminology is as described in [RFC8499].  Note that as in
   [RFC8499], the terms 'primary master' refers to a server that is at
   the root of AXFR/IXFR depency graph and receives updates from UPDATE
   transation.

   Forwarding Server: This is formally defing the servers described i n
   in [RFC2136]. for the terms 'forwarding' refers to a secondary that
   forwards an UPDATE message upward toward the zone's primary master
   server

   DNS terminology is as described in [RFC2136].  Note that as in
   [RFC2136], the terms 'forwarding' refers to a secondary that forwards
   an UPDATE message upward toward the zone's primary master server

   DoT: DNS-over-TLS as specified in [RFC7858]

   Dynamic Update (DU): This is Dynamic Update as specified by [RFC2136]
   which can occur over UDP/TCP.

   Dynamic Update Requestor (DUR) : This is a new term introduced in
   this draft and formally defines the "Requestor" specified in section
   4 of [RFC2136] .

   Dynamic Update ove TLS (DUoT): This is a new term introduced in this
   draft to specify Dyamic Update over TLS.

3.  Dynamic Update threat model

   [RFC2136] specifies that "An update transaction may be carried in a
   UDP datagram, if the request fits, or in a TCP connection".  With
   dynamic updates over tls, all the dynamic updates should be
   transmitted in tcp.

   For a dynamic update between two end points to be considered
   protected with DUoT all update requests and response for that zone
   MUST be sent over TLS connections where at a minimum:

   *  the client MUST authenticate the server by use of an
      authentication domain name using a Strict Privacy Profile as
      described in [RFC8310]

   The server MAY also require a valid TSIG/SIG(0) signature, but this
   alone is not sufficient to authenticate the client or server.

4.  Dynamic Update connection changes

4.1.  Dynamic Update

   [RFC2136] specifies that "An update transaction may be carried in a
   UDP datagram, if the request fits, or in a TCP connection".

            Dynamic Update Requestor          Primary/Forwarding Server
            |            DUR Request            |
            | --------------------------------- |  UDP (or part of
            | --------------------------------- |  a TCP session)
            |           DUR Response            |

4.2.  Dynamic Update over TLS

   MUST use TLS and reuse existing TCP connections.  TCP Fast Open ,
   edns keep alive.  Use "DOT ALPN.  Use TLS 1.3.

6.  Forwarding

   When a zone secondary forwards an UPDATE message upward toward the
   zone's primary server, the forwarder should try TLS first, then fall
   back to either UDP or TCP to forward the message, at the whim of the
   implementor.
